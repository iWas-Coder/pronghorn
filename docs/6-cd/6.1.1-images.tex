@subsection Container Images Registry

A container image registry, or OCI (Open Container Initiative) image registry, is a centralized repository that stores container images, which are pre-packaged software units containing everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries.

One commonly used container image registry is the @b{Docker Registry} (@i{docker.io}), which is widely adopted in the container ecosystem, but there are also several others available, such as @b{Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)}, @b{Google Container Registry (GCR)}, and @b{Azure Container Registry (ACR)}, accessible through several cloud providers.

This registry gets updated with new versions through the CI pipeline of the application being developed.
