@subsection Preproduction/Staging

In the @b{Gitflow} model, the preproduction or @i{staging} environment, represented by the @samp{release-*} type branches, serves as an intermediate environment between the development (@samp{develop}) environment and the production (@samp{master}) environment, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring that the software is thoroughly tested, validated, and ready for deployment as a stable release, in order to mitigate risks of low quality or error-prone code in the production environment.

As describe in the previous section, the @b{collapsed Gitflow} model presents a united development and preproduction environment, often called simply @b{staging}, and it is a lot more compact and simple for smaller teams and more basic applications, while mantaining a defined branch structure and a solid workflow.
