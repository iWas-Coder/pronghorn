@section Background and Legacy Workflows

The field of software development has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, revolutionizing the way teams collaborate, deliver software, and manage infrastructure. Traditional/legacy workflows, characterized by manual processes, lengthy release cycles, and siloed development teams, have presented several challenges for organizations for many years. Their lack of automation and standardized practices results in inconsistency and difficulty in maintaining code quality.

However, as technology evolves and demands for faster and more efficient software delivery increase, these legacy workflows are being replaced by modern approaches, such as @b{Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)} or @b{GitOps} practices. 

This project seeks to replace them with more modern approaches and practices, which are discussed across all chapters in this thesis, aiming to transform the development process into an efficient, automated, and quality-driven goodness.
