A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline has a typical set of stages most projects have to be through in order to deliver the product to the customer, which will be discussed throughout this chapter. This workflow allows development teams catch and fix issues thrown after each stage, ensuring no desired errors are merged to the production environment.

Appart from the obvious benefits of automating this whole process, CI pipelines also promotes collaboration, reduces manual effort, and increases the overall quality, stability and release rate of the software.
