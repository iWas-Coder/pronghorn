Basic Installation
==================

The shell command `make` configures and builds the entire project. If only certain parts of the project wanted to be built, they can be specified as arguments to the previous command, e.g. `make pdf`.

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to figure out how is structured the `Makefile` and what things must be addressed to compile it successfully. If wanted a more generic solution to a specific issue, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` to follow the project's contribution guidelines.
